## 🎯 Overview

The Cryptocurrency Market Analysis System demonstrates advanced Python programming techniques through market analysis algorithms. It serves as an educational resource for:
- Asynchronous programming patterns
- Real-time data processing
- Market analysis algorithms
- System architecture design

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/nadeko0/arbitrage_analysis.git
cd arbitrage_analysis

# Setup environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run analysis
python spread_process_third.py
```

Example output:
```
