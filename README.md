## 🎯 Overview

The Cryptocurrency Market Analysis System demonstrates advanced Python programming techniques through market analysis algorithms. It serves as an educational resource for:
- Asynchronous programming patterns
- Real-time data processing
- Market analysis algorithms
- System architecture design

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/nadeko0/arbitrage_analysis.git
cd arbitrage_analysis

# Setup environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run analysis
python spread_process_third.py
```

Example output:
```

```

## 🔧 Configuration

```python
# config.py - Basic settings
MIN_PROFIT_PERCENTAGE = 0.5  # Minimum profit target
MAX_TRADE_VOLUME = 1000     # Maximum position size
UPDATE_INTERVAL = 300       # Update frequency (seconds)

# Advanced settings
CACHE_EXPIRATION = 60      # Cache lifetime
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 10
REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 15
```

## 📊 Features
